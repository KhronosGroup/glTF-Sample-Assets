## Description

This model demonstrates tow things:
- Reusing the same mesh multiple times by multiple skins.
- Binding multiple skins to a single skeleton.

The model has:
- 1 scene
- 1 mesh
- 4 large skeleton armatures
- 84 skin bindings.

Each skin attaches *the same mesh* to different lengths of the skeletons, so we have 21 skins
bound to multiple lengths of each skeleton.

Using skinning in this way might be seen by some as _abusing_ the glTF format, but it's
actually very useful in some circumstances, and can be used by game engines as a stress
test on how to handle uncommon, -but valid- skinned meshes.

## Animations

The model includes a simple animation where each of the 4 columns twists over a different axis,
propagating the affect to the attached child skeletons.
