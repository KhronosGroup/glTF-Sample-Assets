## Description

This model tests rotational offsets for [`KHR_materials_anisotropy`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_anisotropy).  It has the following features:

- Six of the meshes (2 on the bottom row, 2 in the middle, and 2 on the top row) are all "simple" anisotropy with material roughness extended horizontally along the mesh's `TANGENT` vectors.

- One mesh in the lower-left marked "Tangents + Rotation" has a 30-degree clockwise tilt to the `TANGENT` vectors, and un-does this rotation using the `anisotropyRotation` parameter in radians equivalent to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.  When the rotation is applied correctly, the anisotropy here should look the same as the neighboring meshes.

- One mesh in the upper-left marked "Tangents + Texture" has the same 30-degree clockwise tilt to the `TANGENT` vectors, and un-does this rotation using the `anisotropyTexture` parameter with a 30-degree counter-clockwise tilt encoded in the texture.  As before, when the rotation is applied correctly, the anisotropy here should look the same as the neighboring meshes.

- One mesh in the lower-right marked "Tangents + Texture + Rotation" has again the same 30-degree clockwise tilt to the `TANGENT` vectors as the others.  However this mesh uses a combination of 10 degrees from `anisotropyTexture` and 20 degrees (in radians) from `anisotropyRotation`, combining to create the 30-degree counter-clockwise tilt needed to make the anisotropy horizontal like the other meshes.

- Finally, one mesh in the upper-right marked "Normal map of grooves" has no anisotropy applied at all.  It has a (somewhat grainy) normal texture applied with a series of vertical grooves, intended to approximate the look of very coarse horizontal anisotropy.  It will not look exactly the same as its neighbors, but a bright light source in the environment should still spread out horizontally like its neighbors.

## IBL Example

With a full IBL reflection environment, the model should show horizontal stretching.  It may appear similar to the screenshot above.

## Incorrect Rotation Example

![rotation failure screenshot](screenshot/fail-example.png)

In the above image, the six "Basic Anisotropy" meshes are correct. But on the left side, both the texture-based rotation and JSON-based rotation are incorrect, and in the lower-right, the combination of both is also incorrect. These test meshes use a 30-degree clockwise slant in the tangent vectors that is intended to be undone by a 30-degree counter-clockwise rotation in the material. However in this image, a 60-degree clockwise rotation is visible on all three of these meshes, indicating that the material rotated the opposite way.
