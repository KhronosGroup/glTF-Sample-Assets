## Summary

Box with a non-power-of-2 (NPOT) texture. Not all implementations support NPOT textures. [Issues: non-Khronos mark]

## Description

This model uses a Non Power-Of-Two texture with REPEAT mode wrapping.  This is an edge case that is technically a valid gltf model, but needs some renderer work to resize the texture before uploading to the GPU.  According to the spec:

glTF does not guarantee that a texture's dimensions are a power-of-two. At runtime, if a texture's width or height is not a power-of-two, it may have problems with certain wrapping or filtering modes.

See the Non-Power-Of-Two note at the bottom of the [Samplers section](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0#samplers) of the spec.
