## Description

This model tests the effects of the `KHR_materials_dispersion` extension.

Dispersion requires volumetric transmission (`KHR_materials_transmission` with `KHR_materials_volume`) and also scales with IOR (`KHR_materials_ior`). It changes the effective IOR values for different frequencies of light, producing an effect known as chromatic aberration. In the right-most column, the rainbow-like effect is most pronounced.
