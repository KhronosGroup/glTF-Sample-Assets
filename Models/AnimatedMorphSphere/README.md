## Summary

This sample is similar to the Animated Morph Cube, but the two morph targets move many more vertices and are more extreme than with the cube.

## Description

The sphere contains two morph targets in it:

  * **`blob`** : moves the vertices so that it becomes a somewhat amorphous fat, blob shape.
  * **`ship`** : moves the vertices so that it looks a bit like a spaceship, the goal being
    to just make it a much more complicated morph example than the [cube](../AnimatedMorphCube/README.md).

The animation loops, morphing between these two states.
