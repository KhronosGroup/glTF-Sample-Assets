## Description

This asset demonstrates the use of KHR_materials_diffuse_transmission to represent thin-surface light transmission of green plant leaves with red backscatter. 

The original model is available from [Polyhaven](https://polyhaven.com/a/potted_plant_02). The model was edited with 3ds Max. The leaf textures were edited to show red veins, and assigned the diffuse transmission extension with a red color. 

Fireflies were added, with point lights, and animated to follow a looping path. Chase cameras were added behind the fireflies. 

Stem intersections with obvious shading differences were adjusted so their vertices could be welded together. 

For optimal texture quality, lossless versions of the textures were re-downloaded from Polyhaven, then the asset was optimized with RapidPipeline and an ambient occlusion texture was baked for the pot and the dirt.
