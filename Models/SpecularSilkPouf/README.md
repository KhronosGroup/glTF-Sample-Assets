## Description

This asset demonstrates the use of KHR_materials_specular and KHR_materials_sheen to represent shot-silk fabric on a pouf pillow. 

The material is based on photo reference of real silk fabric, an <a href="http://evashistoricalcostumes.blogspot.com/p/italian-15th-century-gown-in-shot-silk.html">Italian 15th century gown in shot silk</a>. 

The fabric creates an iridescent-like effect by weaving two or more colors in opposing directions with warp and weft silk yarns.
