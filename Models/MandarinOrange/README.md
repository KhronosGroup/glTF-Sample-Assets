## Description

This asset is a test of the glTF extension [`KHR_materials_diffuse_transmission`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/1825) to demonstrate the scattering of light through the fruit of the orange.

_The textures. Top row from left: base color, occlusion, roughness. Bottom row from left: normal, diffuse transmission factor, diffuse transmission color._

The original model on Sketchfab from zandreamer is a photogrammetry asset which only contains a base color texture. All the additional textures were created by processing the base color through a series of filters in various art tools.
